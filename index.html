                      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday inaugurated the first phase of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham here, a project which is spread over five lakh square feet and connects the temple premises to the River Ganga besides providing several facilities to devotees.

                        After arriving in the holy city, also his parliamentary constituency, Mr. Modi paid obeisance at the Kaal Bhairav Temple and then took dip in Ganga from where he collected holy water for worship at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple.
                        
                        People chanted hymns as the prime minister's carcade rolled through the city. Mr. Modi also stopped at some places to accept felicitation.
                        
                        Before the inauguration, Mr. Modi attended a prayer ceremony and later showered workers involved in building the project with flower petals in a gesture to acknowledge their work. He also sat with them for a group photograph. <hr>Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, BJP president J.P. Nadda and a large number of saints from across the country attended the ceremony.

                        The earlier Kashi Vishwanath premises was limited to just 3,000 square feet. Now 23 new buildings have been constructed that will provide diverse facilities to the pilgrims and devotees. The inauguration of the state-of-the-art infrastructure, built at the cost of ₹339 crore, surrounding the historic Kashi Vishwanath Temple near the iconic Dashashwamedh Ghat comes ahead of the assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh early next year.
                        
                        The gateways and other structures have been built with stones and other material using traditional craftsmanship.
                        
                        The PMO had earlier said that it was Mr. Modi's vision for a long time to facilitate pilgrims and devotees of Lord Shiva as they had to encounter congested streets and surroundings with poor upkeep while they went about the age-old custom of taking dip in the holy river, collecting its water and offering it at the temple.<p>

                    <div class="content">
                      <p>Going into the final race of the 2021 Formula One World Championship in Abu Dhabi, two drivers, Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, were tied on 369.5 points in the fight for the drivers’ title.

                        In a remarkable race on December 12 night, Verstappen won the title with a last-lap pass on Hamilton to win the Abu Dhabi GP under controversial circumstances. <hr>

                        <strong>The background</strong>
                        With both drivers tied on points, Hamilton took the lead from pole-sitter Hamilton at the start of the race and was in complete control, keeping his rival at bay. The Red Bull driver was nearly 10-second laps behind Hamilton in second place. Everything looked fine for the British driver to become the first to win eight world titles beating Michael Schumacher’s record of seven titles. <hr>
                        
                        <strong>What happened next?</strong>
                        Four laps before the end of the race, on lap 54, Williams driver Nicholas Latifi crashed into the barriers and the safety car was deployed to clear the debris.
                        
                        Under the safety car period, all drivers must drive to a prescribed speed limit with no overtaking allowed and it bunches up the pack with Hamilton’s lead almost nullified. Verstappen in an opportunistic move stopped for new tyres during this period so that he would have a chance to attack if racing resumed. <hr>
                        
                        <strong>Controversy begins</strong>
                        
                        However, there were five lapped cars between Hamilton and Verstappen. Usually, before racing resumes, race control allows lapped cars — cars that are a lap down to the ladders — to unlap themselves by overtaking the safety car and join the queue behind.
                        
                        On lap 56, there was a message saying lapped cars will not be allowed to overtake the safety car, which would have meant had the race resumed, Verstappen would be further behind Hamilton even though the lapped cars would have got out of his way. The Red Bull team boss immediately spoke to the race director protesting this.
                        
                        Suddenly on lap 57, the race director allowed five cars between Hamilton and Verstappen alone to unlap themselves and gave the message “safety car in this lap” allowing one lap of racing.
                        
                        It is here that the controversy started. According to the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) F1 Sporting Regulations, Article 48.12, “any cars that have been lapped by the leader will be required to pass the cars on the lead lap and the safety car.”
                        
                        The regulation also states, “Once the last lapped car has passed the leader, the safety car will return to the pits at the end of the following lap.”
                        
                        This meant all cars, and not only five, should have been allowed to unlap the leader and also that safety car could have come in only on the following lap i.e. lap 58, which meant the race would have ended behind safety car with Hamilton sealing the title.
                        
                        Instead, once the five cars passed, the safety car came into the pits on lap 57 itself, with Verstappen right behind Hamilton.
                        
                        When racing resumed, he was able to pass the latter on track with his fresher tyres to win the race and secure his first championship.</p>

                        In a remarkable race on December 12 night, Verstappen won the title with a last-lap pass on Hamilton to win the Abu Dhabi GP under controversial circumstances. <hr>

                        <strong>The background</strong>
                        With both drivers tied on points, Hamilton took the lead from pole-sitter Hamilton at the start of the race and was in complete control, keeping his rival at bay. The Red Bull driver was nearly 10-second laps behind Hamilton in second place. Everything looked fine for the British driver to become the first to win eight world titles beating Michael Schumacher’s record of seven titles. <hr>
                        
                        <strong>What happened next?</strong>
                        Four laps before the end of the race, on lap 54, Williams driver Nicholas Latifi crashed into the barriers and the safety car was deployed to clear the debris.
                        
                        Under the safety car period, all drivers must drive to a prescribed speed limit with no overtaking allowed and it bunches up the pack with Hamilton’s lead almost nullified. Verstappen in an opportunistic move stopped for new tyres during this period so that he would have a chance to attack if racing resumed. <hr>
                        
                        <strong>Controversy begins</strong>
                        
                        However, there were five lapped cars between Hamilton and Verstappen. Usually, before racing resumes, race control allows lapped cars — cars that are a lap down to the ladders — to unlap themselves by overtaking the safety car and join the queue behind.
                        
                        On lap 56, there was a message saying lapped cars will not be allowed to overtake the safety car, which would have meant had the race resumed, Verstappen would be further behind Hamilton even though the lapped cars would have got out of his way. The Red Bull team boss immediately spoke to the race director protesting this.
                        
                        Suddenly on lap 57, the race director allowed five cars between Hamilton and Verstappen alone to unlap themselves and gave the message “safety car in this lap” allowing one lap of racing.
                        
                        It is here that the controversy started. According to the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) F1 Sporting Regulations, Article 48.12, “any cars that have been lapped by the leader will be required to pass the cars on the lead lap and the safety car.”
                        
                        The regulation also states, “Once the last lapped car has passed the leader, the safety car will return to the pits at the end of the following lap.”
                        
                        This meant all cars, and not only five, should have been allowed to unlap the leader and also that safety car could have come in only on the following lap i.e. lap 58, which meant the race would have ended behind safety car with Hamilton sealing the title.
                        
                        Instead, once the five cars passed, the safety car came into the pits on lap 57 itself, with Verstappen right behind Hamilton.
                        
                        When racing resumed, he was able to pass the latter on track with his fresher tyres to win the race and secure his first championship.</p>
